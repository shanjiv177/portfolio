*Please note that the motive of this article is not to push everyone to use Linux, it is rather intended just to make everyone aware, that Windows is not their only option (there are people who think that way). The primary motive of this article is to make people explore various new things in tech.*

Much of the world right now uses Windows as its primary Operating System. This is mainly due to the fact that most laptops and PCs come pre-installed with Windows. But there are other operating systems that you could try out as well, some of them are much better than Windows. Linux Distributions and MacOS are the two mainstream alternatives to Windows. But, yeah, MacOS is expensive to get started on (though you can explore hackintosh :XD). Let's go with Linux for now.

**Please read this article till the end.**

### Linux is Open Source

It means anyone around the globe (ok, I stand corrected, even from outerspace) can view and modify the source code. You can contribute to the development of your OS if you'd like to. If you do not like to do so? even then, the source code being open, should increase your confidence in using it. And it's **FREE.**

### Customization

Linux gives you complete control over the OS that you use. You can change whatever you want (PS: you can delete your boot dir too, please don't try that if you are a beginner). There are many options for you to try, you don't like the UI or how the windows appears in your desktop, you can change that. You don't like the login screen, you can change that. Or if you are a person who likes to keep everything on default, then there are distros with a good set of default behaviors as well.

### Ease of use and Better development environment

Having a package manager, like apt, which can handle all your packages' installation, updates and removal is such a boon in disguise. It just makes your like a whole lot easier. No more navigating through dozen of pages in a Dialog Box while installing a something. Especially for developers or hobby coders, it comes with a lot of preinstalled tools that can get you started with your work in no time.

### Strong Community Support

Any problem with your computer? There are thousands of people in the community who are ready to help you with it. No need to wait for the consumer support of any brand in order to get your issue fixed.

### Exploring Tech

Once you start using Linux, you would be naturally tempted to use the CLI instead of GUI for many things though almost all of those things can be achieved via GUI in Linux. This will enable you to learn more about the machine that you use and how exactly most things work under the hood. If you start exploring Linux in detail, there are numerous things that you can learn about technology in general.
